//! Standardized isolation of logic as a `process` wrapper around a `thread`.
//!
//! Basic wrapper around threads to provide some standard API. All long-living Hat threads run
//! as a `process`. The main difference between a normal Rust `thread` and a Hat `process` is
//! currently that the `process` has a bounded input-channel and a standard implementation of a
//! synchronous `send_reply()`.

/// A long-living `thread` is promoted to a standard `process`.
///
/// To create a new `process`, simply define a `Msg` type, a `Reply` type and a state struct
/// that implements the `MsgHandler` trait. You can then create a new process with:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// enum Msg {Ping, Foo}
/// enum Reply {Pong, Bar}
///
/// struct MyHandler {
///   fn handle(&mut self, msg: Msg, reply: |Reply|) {
///     match Msg {
///       Ping => return reply(Pong),
///       Foo => return reply(Bar),
///     }
///   }
/// }
///
/// fn main() {
///   let p = Process::new(MyHandler::new());
///   let pong = p.send_reply(Ping);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The handler must always call `reply()` to release any call to `send_reply()`. It is allowed to
/// call `reply()` "early" - before all work has been done - but calling `reply()` is usually the
/// last thing a handler does. The idiom `return reply(...)` is a simple way of guaranteeing this.
///
/// A handler is allowed to call `reply()` **exactly** once. Not calling it or calling it multiple
/// times will likely cause runtime panicure when using `send_reply()`.
